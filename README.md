# Rails API

This project models a Media review site with User registration, authentication, and the following relationships:  

![Model of Database](https://cdn.buttercms.com/Vs4yJ4I0QPm9mSSGOtyb)

This is a simplified version of the [previous media reviews](https://github.com/endotnick/media-reviews) site that is API only, with a [decoupled frontend](https://github.com/endotnick/media-reviews-frontend) built with React and Redux.

## Installation

Clone the repo and install dependencies

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/endotnick/media-reviews-api.git
$ bundle install
```

Set PostgreSQL credentials in `config\database.yml`

Migrate and Seed dev DB:

```bash
$ rake db:create
$ rake db:migrate
$ rake db:seed
```
Note: You may see a validation error on seeding in the rare event that the semi-randomly generated object has been previously generated. This is fine for testing.

Generate secrets used for auth

```bash
$ Editor=vim rails credentials:edit
```
Enter `:q` to exit vim

## Development

After installation, run 

```bash
$ rails s -p 3001
```
to launch the dev server.   
Now, you'll need to [install the frontend](https://github.com/endotnick/media-reviews-frontend)
